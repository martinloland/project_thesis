\figref{result_img} shows a robot configuration halfway through an animation where the dynamic contribution is (a) turned off and (b) turned on. Since no inertial forces are considered in \figref{result_static} it is expected that this would produce results similar to a static case. The velocities in blue are the same in both figures but some differences in force and torque can be seen.

Firstly, in the static case the joint forces only contain a vertical component. This is as expected as the resulting joint force should only be a result of gravity forces only. When considering inertial forces in (b) it is clear that they now have a horizontal component. This is coherent with the velocity (and acceleration) that can be
