\section{Background}

\todo[inline]{
\textbf{Todo}

- Define what is meant by \textit{robot}

- The use of robots in today's  society

- Robots are physical components and therefore it is very important to model the physical parameters and behaviour if we are to successful control them

- GeoMod background and intention

- GeoMod's limitations with connecting kinematic behaviour to dynamic properties such as inertia and resulting torques

\section{Motivation}

\figref{exampleCase} shows a typical robot configuration used in an industrial application. The robot is a \glsf{6R} with fixed base and a suction cup at it's \glsf{endeff}. This robot will be used as an example to discuss why describing dynamics can be helpful, but the same points can be made for any other robot configuration.

\begin{figure}[h!]    
    \centering           
    \def\svgwidth{.8\columnwidth}
    \input{inkscape/exampleCase.pdf_tex}
    \caption{An industrial robot used for moving packages}
    \label{exampleCase}
\end{figure}

The figure shows a robot used for moving packages around in the \glsf{workspace}. If the robot were to move it's \gls{endeff} from the current position to the package it would have to rotate the first joint as visualized in the figure. When it has reached down to the package it would have to press down on the package with a particular force and active the suction cup to lift the package.

This situation raises a few interesting questions and difficulties for a person programming the robot. Let's assume the end position and orientation of the \gls{endeff} is given, then it's easy to calculate each of the joint variables $\theta (t)$ as a function of time, \figref{plot_position}. A problem arises if the programmer want the robot to move as fast as possible. If not accounting for the inertial forces the robot might overshoot the wanted configuration and you end up with an oscillation around the wanted angle, \figref{plot_position_over}. By continuously calculating the inertia it is possible to determine when an opposite torque has to be applied to the motor to move the robot as fast as possible without oscillation.

The same method can be used as engineering guidance when selecting which motors to use for a specific task. If a robot has to perform a specific task with a certain speed, a dynamic analysis can determine the torque and force requirements for that task so that motors and bearings can be chosen accordingly.

    \label{plot_position_over}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Adjusting the joint angle correctly and with an overshoot}
\label{joint_position}
\end{figure}

Another issue arises when the suction cup has to press down on the package. The robot has to press down with sufficient force, but not too much as this could damage the package. Simple moment equations can be used to calculate this for a static situation, but in a situation where the package and/or the robot is moving, the inertial forces has to be accounted for when making these calculations.


\section{Objective}

\todo[inline]{
\textbf{Todo}

- Implement a new framework / class structure in GeoMod which is able to calculate joint torque and force because of gravity, external loads and inertial forces


}

\section{Approach}

\todo[inline]{
\textbf{Todo}

- develop a good understanding of relevant theory

- find a good framework and algorithm for calculating torque and force for joints in a serial manipulator because of gravity, external loads and inertial forces

- do rapid prototyping / tests on the calculations to check their validity and effectiveness

- find a good strategy for combining current work in GeoMod and the new functionality

- A good framework is one which will work for a broad spectrum of different configuration. It is therefore important to find a general solution which does not require any specific / hard coded parameters.
