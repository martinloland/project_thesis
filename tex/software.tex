\section{Representing time}

A computer works in clock cycles and has no understanding of time, but it is equipped with a crystal oscillator that oscillate at a constant frequency. By counting the number of cycles in the crystal it can calculate the elapsed time. The \texttt{clock()} function contained in the standard c++ \texttt{time.h} library returns the total number of $ms$ elapsed since the program started. This has been used to calculate time-dependent animation and derivatives.
