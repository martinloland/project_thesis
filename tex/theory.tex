\chapter{Theory}\label{secTheory}
%This chapter will develop the relationships between rigid motion, kinematics, velocity and dynamics. A successful framework will rely heavily on the theoretical background so the content of the coming chapters will strongly build on the theory presented in this part.

%\subsubsection{Nomenclature and terminology}\label{frameSection}

\vspace{-0.8cm}

The following chapter will develop the most used expressions for calculations of dynamic behaviour in a linked mechanism. Most of the notation and conventions will follow \textit{Robot Modeling and Control} by Spong (2006). \cite{spong}

A robotic manipulator consists of multiple links and joints, the position and orientation of these links can be represented as multiple \glsf{frame}\textit{s}. Sometimes \textit{reference frame} will be used to describe the same thing. The frame is defined with three orthogonal unit vectors and position relative to another frame.

The first frame in a serial manipulator is called the \glsf{inertialframe} and denoted $O_0$ (big letter O and subscript zero). It is defined to have position and rotation equal to zero, see \figref{frames}. The next frame in the chain is $O_1$ and is connected to $O_0$ through link 1.

Joint 1 ($q_1$ in the figure) is situated in the origo of $O_0$, while joint 2 is located at $O_1$. In general, link $n$ connects to joint $n$ and $n+1$. Joint $n$ is in the same position as $O_{n-1}$ so that when joint $n$ is actuated, link $n$ and frame $n$ is moved accordingly. The variable $q$ will be used to denote the joint variable. This is the angular displacement for a revolute joint or linear displacement for a prismatic (linear) joint.

\section{Rigid motion}
\subsection{Position and rotation}

\subsubsection{Rotation in three dimensions}

Frame $O_1$ in \figref{frames} has a rotation with respect to $O_0$, in this case a positive z-rotation $q_1$, using the right hand rule. It is helpful to express an arbitrary rotation in all three dimensions and this is the intention of the rotation matrix, \eqref{rotmatrix}. This is a $3\times3$ matrix and can be found by taking the vector products of the unit vectors as in the equation. $R_1^0$ will describe the \textit{rotation matrix} from $O_0$ to $O_1$. By post multiplying $R_1^0$ with a position vector with respect to $O_1$, $p^1$, it is possible to obtain the coordinates to the same point $p^0$, but now with respect to $O_0$, see \eqref{pointrotation}.

This is only considering a rotation of the frame, not translation as will be described shortly. For a 2D scenario where only rotation along the z-axis is possible the matrix would reduce to \eqref{rot2d}

%If reference frame $O_0$ is rotated in all three dimensions to $O_1$ the \textit{rotation matrix} can be described as the projection of the unit axis in $O_1$ onto $O_0$ as in \eqref{rotmatrix}. This matrix will be used to express point $p^1$ in the reference frame of $O_0$, \eqref{pointrotation}. The same rotation matrix can also be used as an operator to rotate a vector in a fixed reference frame.
\begin{equation}\label{rotmatrix}
R^0_1=\begin{bmatrix}
x_1\cdot x_0 & y_1\cdot x_0 & z_1\cdot x_0\\ 
x_1\cdot y_0 & y_1\cdot y_0 & z_1\cdot y_0\\ 
x_1\cdot z_0 & y_1\cdot z_0 & z_1\cdot z_0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{pointrotation}
p^0 = R^0_1p^1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{rot2d}
R^0_1(q_1)_z=\begin{bmatrix}
cos\left ( q_1 \right ) & -sin\left ( q_1 \right ) & 0\\ 
sin\left ( q_1 \right ) & cos\left ( q_1 \right ) & 0\\ 
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Composition of rotational transformations}

If $R^0_1$ and $R^1_2$ represents rotational transformations between reference frames \textit{0, 1} and \textit{1, 2}. Then point $p^2$ can be described in terms of $O_0$ as in \eqref{rotationcomposition}. In general, the rotation matrix from $O_i$ to $O_n$ can be found by \eqref{Rcompositioninf}.

\begin{equation}\label{rotationcomposition}
p^0 = R^0_1 R^1_2 p^2
\end{equation}
\vspace{-0.4cm}
\begin{equation}\label{Rcompositioninf}
R^i_n = \prod_{i=i}^{n-1} R^i_{i+1}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Parametrisation of rotations}

In equation \eqref{rotmatrix} the transformation were described in terms of nine independent variables. A rotation in 3D space can at most have three independent variables and it is therefore convenient to perform a parametrization to get three independent variables. Three methods are \textit{euler angles}, \textit{roll pitch yaw} or \textit{axis/angle} representation. This is left here as a reference for future studies, but since one link can only rotate around one axis the parametrisation is not needed.

\subsection{Rigid motion}

Rigid motion is a combination of rotation and translation. The matrix form is described as a \textit{homogeneous transformation} and is defined as a set of matrices as in \eqref{homeqn}. \textit{R} is the rotation matrix as described before and \textit{d} is the translation vector with respect to a chosen frame. The same features of composition as described in \eqref{Rcompositioninf} also applies to homogeneous transformation.

\begin{equation}\label{homeqn}
H = \begin{bmatrix}
R_{3x3} & d_{3x1}\\ 
0_{1x3} & 1_{1x1}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & d_{1}\\ 
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & d_{2}\\ 
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & d_{3}\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}


\section{Kinematics}

To describe the dynamics in a serial manipulator or robots in general it's kinematic relationships has to be used. In this section the forward and inverse kinematics will be described shortly and will form the basis for velocity kinematics and dynamics.

\subsection{Denavit-Hartenberg convention}

The homogeneous transformation as described in \eqref{homeqn} is a matrix of six independent variables. But introducing two constraints on how the reference frames are defined with respect to each other the total number of independent variables can be reduced to four. This is the motivation behind the \textit{\gls{DH}} (D-H), first introduced in 1955 \cite{DH}. This convention also provides a common, well known framework for defining robotic systems among engineers and has been broadly adopted.

A D-H transformation is defined as a product of four basic transformations, \eqref{DH}. Where $a_i, \alpha_i, d_i $ and $\theta_i$ represents the link length, link twist, link offset and joint angle respectively, for link number \textit{i}. The homogeneous transformation matrix from $O_0$ to the \gls{endeff} $n$ will then be the product sum of the transformations for each link, \eqref{DHsum}.

\begin{align}\label{DH}
\begin{split}
A_i &= Rot_{z,\theta_i}Trans_{z,d_i}Trans_{x,a_i}Rot_{x,\alpha_i} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix}
c_{\theta_i} & -s_{\theta_i}c_{\alpha_i} & s_{\theta_i}s_{\alpha_i} & a_{i}c_{\theta_i} \\ 
s_{\theta_i} & c_{\theta_i}c_{\alpha_i} & -c_{\theta_i}s_{\alpha_i} & a_{i}s_{\theta_i} \\ 
0 & s_{\alpha_i} & c_{\alpha_i} & d_i \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{split}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}\label{DHsum}
T^0_n=\prod_{i=1}^{n}A_i
\end{equation}

In essence, this establishes the forward kinematic relationship. Each link in the robot can be defined as in \eqref{DH} where either $\theta_i$ or $d_i$ is the varying variable depending on the joint is revolute or prismatic. Lastly, \eqref{DHsum} will give the position and rotation of the end effector with respect to the inertial frame.

\subsection{Inverse kinematics}

Given a specific \gls{homo} $H$, the problem of inverse kinematics is to solve the forward kinematic equations for it's joint variables such that the transformation matrix of the robot arm equals that of $H$, \eqref{inverse_kin}.

\begin{equation}\label{inverse_kin}
T^0_n = H
\end{equation}

This approach will at most result in twelve nonlinear equations with twelve unknowns and can be very difficult to solve. It is advised to find a geometric solution as this will shorten the computational \todo{insert reference} time. This approach will depend on the actual configuration of the robot and no further theoretical development on a general basis is needed.

\section{Velocity kinematics}
At this point the forward and inverse relationship for the robot has been defined. This section will describe how the velocity of any point on the robot can be defined with respect to the joint variables and it's velocities. This is important for accurate control of the end effector's velocity and when it comes to 
dynamics as we need to know the velocity and acceleration of the mass centres.
\subsection{Jacobian}

A relationship between the joint velocities and the velocity of a specific point on the robot has to be established. This is the purpose of the $Jacobian$ related to that point, \eqref{jacobian}. Where the linear and angular velocity of point $n$ with respect to the inertial frame $O_0$, $V^0_n$ and $\omega^0_n$ respectively is a product of the Jacobian $J$ and the joint velocities $\dot{q}$. 

\begin{align}\label{jacobian}
\begin{split}
\xi &= J\dot{q}\\
\begin{bmatrix}
V^0_n\\ 
\omega^0_n
\end{bmatrix}_{6\times 1}
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
J_v\\ 
J_\omega
\end{bmatrix}_{6\times n} \begin{bmatrix}
\dot{q}
\end{bmatrix}_{n\times 1}
\end{split}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}\label{Jvel}
J_v = \begin{bmatrix}
J_{v_1} & J_{v_2} & ... & J_{v_n}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{Jomega}
J_{\omega} = \begin{bmatrix}
z_0 & z_1 & ... & z_{n-1}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{Jvi}
J_{v_i} = z_{i-1}\times (O_n - O_{i-1})
\end{equation}

Each part of the Jacobian, \Crefrange{Jvel}{Jvi} describes how the rotation of one joint affects the velocity at point $n$. The values can be found from the correct columns in the corresponding homogeneous transformation, \eqref{homeqn} describing that point. Specifically, $z=\begin{matrix}[
r_{13} & r_{23} & r_{33}]
\end{matrix}^T$ and $O=\begin{matrix}[
d_{1} & d_{2} & d_{3}]
\end{matrix}^T$.

\eqref{jacobian} provides the linear and angular velocity vectors of the point in question. The absolute velocity can then be calculated by \eqref{absvel}. Here the superscript $0$ are left out for simplicity and $r_n$ denotes the vector from the inertial frame to the point $n$.

\begin{equation}\label{absvel}
v_{n}=V_n+\omega_n\times r_n
\end{equation}

\subsection{Force and torque relationship}

The Jacobian in \eqref{jacobian} has a special property. If \\$F = \begin{matrix}[
F_{x} & F_{y} & F_{z} & n_x & n_y & n_z]^T
\end{matrix}$ is the force and torque vector at the end effector, the transpose of the Jacobian then describes the torques at each joint, \eqref{Jtorque}. This will prove helpful when the same equation can be used to find torques at the joints because of dynamic forces.

\begin{equation}\label{Jtorque}
\tau = J^T F
\end{equation}

\section{Dynamics}

The goal of this section is to develop at method to determine the force and torque in every joint as a result of the mass and mass distributions, orientation, velocity and acceleration of each link in the chain. To be able to do this, some physical properties has to be defined. The 2-link planar robot will be used as previous for visualization, but the concept apply to any other angular or prismatic configuration.

In \figref{speed} the angular velocity and acceleration along with the linear acceleration is presented. The linear velocity is left out as this does not have any effect on forces.

    \caption{Velocity and acceleration properties}
    \label{speed}
\end{figure}

The joint forces and torques together with the gravitational force are presented in \figref{forces}. If there are any end effector forces these will be denoted $f_e$ and $\tau_e$. The gravity is denoted $g_i$ as this vector will be defined with respect to the link in question and may change.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Kinetic and potential energy}

\todo[inline]{
\textbf{Todo}

- Maybye this section is not needed at all
}

Any applied force or torque to a system will result in a change in kinetic and potential energy. It is therefore valuable to describe these relations as this will aid in the process of finding the required torques at each link to achieve a specific movement.

The kinetic energy $K$ of a single body is described in \eqref{kineticE}. Note that the linear and angular velocity, $v$ and $\omega$, are the velocities of the center of mass for that body with respect to the fixed frame. The frame attached to this point is called the \glsf{bodyframe} and are used for most of the calculations when it comes to dynamics. $\mathbf{I}$ represents the inertia tensor with respect to the \gls{inertialframe}. This tensor will change with the configuration of the body, but the inertia tensor with respect to the \gls{bodyframe} $I$ will stay constant. These are related as in \eqref{Irelated}.

\begin{equation}\label{kineticE}
K = \frac{1}{2}mv^Tv + \frac{1}{2}\omega ^{T}  I \omega
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{Irelated}
\mathbf{I} = RIR^T
\end{equation}

The potential energy is simply the mass times gravity and height, \eqref{potentialE}. $r_c$ is the vector from the reference frame to the mass center.

\begin{equation}\label{potentialE}
P = mg^Tr_c
\end{equation}



\subsection{Newton-Euler formulation}

An interesting and maybe the most important question that can be asked when it comes to dynamics for a robot is the following: What kind of torques on each link $\mathbf{\tau}(t)$ is needed to perform a particular movement $\mathbf{q}(t)$? Or put in another way, given the current position, velocity and acceleration $\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}$ and $ \mathbf{\ddot{q}}$, what is the resulting torque $\mathbf{\tau}$? One method to solve this is with the \glsf{nef}. This method is especially relevant for computer calculations because of it's recursive nature. With reference to the generalized link $i$ in \figref{newtonEuler}, the  \gls{nef} will now be described in it's two steps, forward and backward recursion.

\begin{figure}[h!]    
    \centering           
    \def\svgwidth{\columnwidth}
    \input{inkscape/newtonEuler.pdf_tex}
    \caption{Newton-Euler variables for link i}
    \label{newtonEuler}
\end{figure}

On a general level, \gls{nef} works by setting the change in linear and angular momentum, \eqref{linear_mom} and \eqref{angular_mom} respectively, equal to it's applied forces and torques. The forward step starts with link $1$ and continues until link $n$. Joint zero is always fixed so $\omega_0, \alpha_0, a_{c;0}, a_{e,0}$ are all zero. Then solve $\omega_0, \alpha_0, a_{c;0}, a_{e,0}$ from \Crefrange{omega}{a_center}.

\begin{equation}\label{linear_mom}
\dot{p}_i = m_i a_{ci}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{angular_mom}
\dot{h}_i = I_i \alpha_i + \omega_i \times \left ( I_i \omega_i \right )
\end{equation}

\begin{align}\label{omega}
\begin{split}
\omega_i &= \left ( R^{i-1}_i \right )^T\omega_{i-1} + b_i\dot{q}_i\\
b_i &= \left ( R^0_i \right )^T z_{i-1}
\end{split}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}\label{alpha}
\alpha_i = \left ( R^{i-1}_i \right )^T\alpha_{i-1} + b_i\ddot{q}_i+\omega_i \times b_i\dot{q}_i
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{a_end}
a_{e,i} = \left ( R^{i-1}_i \right )^T a_{e,i-1} + \dot{\omega}_i \times r_{i,i+1}+\omega_i \times \left ( \omega_i \times r_{i,i+1} \right )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{a_center}
a_{c,i} = \left ( R^{i-1}_i \right )^T a_{e,i-1} + \dot{\omega}_i \times r_{i,ci}+\omega_i \times \left ( \omega_i \times r_{i,ci} \right )
\end{equation}

Lastly, the backward recursion starts with the last link $n$ and works itself backward until link 1. This step finds the force and torque in each link by solving the equilibrium in \Crefrange{linear_equi}{angular_equi}. An overview of the \gls{nef} as an algorithm is presented in \algref{nefAlgo}.

\begin{equation}\label{linear_equi}
\dot{p}_i = f_i - R^i_{i+1} f_{i+1} + m_i g_i
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{angular_equi}
\dot{h}_i = \tau_i - R^i_{i+1}\tau_{i+1} + f_i \times r_{i,ci}-\left ( R^i_{i+1}f_{i+1} \right ) \times r_{i+1,ci}
\end{equation}
