\section{Mass and inertia}
\todo[inline]{
\textbf{Todo}

- user can add point masses to the link or define a inertia

- show how inertia is calculated
}
\section{Calculating parameters}
\todo[inline]{
\textbf{Todo}

- describe how each of the parameters from the theory is calculated
}
\section{Derivatives}

\todo[inline]{
\textbf{Todo}

- How is the derivatives of the parameters calculated
}

\section{Implementing the Newton-Euler formulation}

\todo[inline]{
\textbf{Todo}

- How is the method formulated so that this is calculated correctly
}

\section{Visualization}

\todo[inline]{
\textbf{Todo}

- force and torque can be seen changing as the robot is moving

- user can select to show forces because of gravity, external load and inertia

- Show image of robot movement (position at n and n+1) and how this affect the forces and torques
